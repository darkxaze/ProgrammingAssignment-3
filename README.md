Description
-------
In this repository you can find the following files

1. The content of each file is explained by README.md 

2. The CodeBook.md provides a description of variables (the overview is outlined above under the run\ analysis.R description) and data and any transformations or works performed to clean up information.

3. TidyData.txt is a tidy set of data which has the mean and standard variation for each measurement and activity with the subject ID.

4.  run\_analysis.R is a R script that does the following:

-   merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
-   extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
-   uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-   labels the data set with descriptive variable names
-   creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
